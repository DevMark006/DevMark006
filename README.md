- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @DevMark006. You can call me Mark. I'm interested working on many projects especially in web and software development.
- I'm currently learning and improving my coding skills and knowledge in different programming languages.
- I had some previous experiences and projects done in these languanges (HTML, CSS, PYTHON, JAVA, C++, and R).
- Now I wanted to focus on deep learning python and java and since python is quite simple to understand also java and python are object-oriented languages.
- Hope we can collaborate and learn together, Thank you!
